# Haptic-Vibration-Motor-Controlling-STM32

## Introduction

This is DRV2605L based haptic motor driver controlling library for STM32 platform. Library modified by using arduino library and modified proper core functions in the code. This device is communicate with the MCU through the I2C communication. Operating voltage of the device is 3.3V-5V. Interesting thiog is this controller has builtin vibration patterns can be use via I2C. In My situation i used [Adafruit Haptic Controller Breakot Board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-drv2605-haptic-controller-breakout/arduino-code). 

## Implementation

Before using this library i recomend to familiar with [CudeMx IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) and [Atollic TrueSTUDIO IDE](https://atollic.com/truestudio/) for programming the STM32 MCU. 
All module initializations are come with the main code generated by CubeMX. Need to modify the main methos as our requirements. If you wans to modify this library for any other kind of MCU, first you need to understand the I2C operations of the MCU and need to identify the core communication methods of the library.
